Uncovering Insights in Student Performance Data ðŸ“Š

In my latest data analysis project, I dove deep into a dataset of student test scores, demographics, and family backgrounds. Using Python, I explored the factors that influence academic success, from gender distributions to the impact of parent education and marital status.

Key highlights:

Visualized gender patterns in the student population
Analyzed the relationship between parent education levels and test scores
Investigated the effects of family dynamics on student performance
Identified potential outliers in the data
This project allowed me to hone my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. I'm excited to continue exploring the power of data to uncover meaningful insights.

Let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions on how I can expand this analysis further
